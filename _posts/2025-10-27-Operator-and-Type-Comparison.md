**Welcome back, Forks!** üëã In the last post, we compared the **execution structure** and **philosophy** of four languages through "Hello World!".

This time, we're tackling a much more practical topic: **Arithmetic Operations**. Specifically, we'll compare how each language reads, processes, and calculates **A+B, A-B, A\*B, A/B (Quotient), and A%B (Remainder)** after taking two integers, **A** and **B**, as user input.

This exercise will clearly highlight the importance of **'Data Types'** and **'Integer Quotient Operators'** in each language.

## üí° Core Comparison Points: Input and Integer Quotient

| Comparison Factor | üêç Python | üíª C++, ‚òï Java, üõ†Ô∏è C# | Key Difference |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Data Type Handling** | **Dynamic Type**: Explicit conversion during input is essential. | **Static Type**: Type (`int`, `string`) declaration is mandatory when defining variables. | **Static-type** languages catch errors at the **compile stage**, offering higher speed and stability. |
| **Input (A, B)** | Read with `input().split()` then converted with `int()`. | Read with `ReadLine()` then converted via `Parse()` or `>>` operator. | Compiled languages require a more involved **type casting/parsing** process than scripting (Python). |
| **Integer Quotient (A/B)** | Uses the **`//` operator** (Floor Division). | Uses the **`/` operator** (Division between two integers). | Python's standard division (`/`) returns a **float** (decimal), necessitating a **separate operator** for the integer quotient. |

## üíª Code Comparison: Arithmetic Operations Implementation

### 1. üêç Python: Flexible Type Conversion

Python is the most flexible. Arithmetic is only possible after explicitly converting the string input using the **`int()`** function, and it uses the **`//`** operator for integer division.

```python
A, B = map(int, input().split())  # Convert strings to integers

print(A + B)
print(A - B)
print(A * B)
print(A // B)  # Integer Quotient Operator (Floor Division)
print(A % B)
```

### 2. üíª C++: Stream-based Input and iostream

C++ uses the `cin` object and the `>>` operator from `<iostream>` to read values directly from the input stream. The `/` operator between two integers (`int`) automatically yields the integer quotient.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int A, B; 
    
    // Reads two space-separated integers directly into A and B via the cin stream
    std::cin >> A >> B;

    std::cout << A + B << '\n';
    std::cout << A - B << '\n';
    std::cout << A * B << '\n';
    std::cout << A / B << '\n';  // int/int returns the integer quotient
    std::cout << A % B << '\n';
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. ‚òï Java: Strict Class Structure and Standard Input

Java relies on the `Scanner` class to handle input. As a static-type language, the variables `A` and `B` must be explicitly declared as `int`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;  // Import the Scanner class for input handling

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to handle standard input (System.in)
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int A = sc.nextInt();  // Reads input as an integer
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        sc.close();  // Close the Scanner object

        System.out.println(A + B);
        System.out.println(A - B);
        System.out.println(A * B);
        System.out.println(A / B);  // int/int returns the integer quotient
        System.out.println(A % B);
    }
}
```

### 4. üõ†Ô∏è C#: .NET Standard Input and LINQ Parsing

C# reads the entire line with `Console.ReadLine()`, then uses `Split()` and the `Select(int.Parse)` LINQ method to efficiently convert the string tokens into integers. Note the required `System.Linq` import.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;  // Crucial for using the Select(int.Parse) method

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Read a line, split by space, parse to integer, and convert to array
        int[] input = Console.ReadLine()
                             .Split(' ')
                             .Select(int.Parse)
                             .ToArray();

        int A = input[0];
        int B = input[1];

        Console.WriteLine(A + B);
        Console.WriteLine(A - B);
        Console.WriteLine(A * B);
        Console.WriteLine(A / B);  // int/int returns the integer quotient
        Console.WriteLine(A % B);
    }
}
```

## ü§ù Similarities and Differences in Action

The comparison above reveals more than just syntax:

### üîé The Similarities

The fundamental purpose and symbol of the basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `%`) remain identical across all four languages. The mathematical logic is universal.

### üíî The Biggest Differences: Type and Operators

| Factor | Python | C++, C#, Java |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Integer Division** | Uses `//` (Floor Division) | Uses `/` (Context-Dependent Division) |
| **Input Method** | Uses a built-in function (`input()`) | Relies on external libraries/classes (`iostream`, `Scanner`, `Console`) |

## üß† Deep Dive into Core Concepts

### 1. Why is Python Code the Simplest? üêç

Python's simplicity stems from its design as a scripting and dynamically-typed language:

- **No Class/Main Function**: Python's Interpreter executes code sequentially from the first line, eliminating the need for the verbose class and main structure required by compiled, object-oriented languages.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables don't need their type (`int`, `string`) pre-declared. The type is determined during runtime, leading to cleaner code but requiring explicit manual conversion (`int()`) when processing initial string input.

### 2. The Role of `#include <iostream>` in C++ üõ†Ô∏è

In C++, `iostream` stands for "Input/Output Stream."

- **Header File**: C++ provides a minimal core. Functions for screen output or user input are not built-in; they must be explicitly imported using the preprocessor directive `#include`.
- **The Toolbox**: `iostream` acts as the standard library toolbox containing the necessary tools, specifically the `cin` (input) and `cout` (output) stream objects, enabling interaction with the console.

## üîë Conclusion: The Language Philosophy Behind the Operator

This simple arithmetic problem confirms the core philosophies of the languages:

- **Python**: Prioritizes readability and convenience. It standardized the standard division (`/`) to always return a float (decimal) and introduced a separate operator (`//`) for integer division to maximize beginner friendliness.
- **C++, C#, and Java**: Value performance and the strictness of data types. The division operator (`/`) is highly context-dependent: dividing two integers will always result in an integer, directly reflecting the type-safe nature of these compiled languages.

Next time, we'll shift from math to logic by implementing conditional statements (if/else) and comparing how the code handles branching logic across these four languages. Stay tuned!
